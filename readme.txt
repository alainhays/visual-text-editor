It will make default Text Widget to Visual Text Widget without losing data.

== Description ==

The Default WP Text Widget which is included in all WordPress installations allows you to display any custom plain/html text content in the widget areas of your website in front end, which is usually in the sidebar and footer areas. 
Replaces the default functionality of Text Widget editor with the WordPress visual editor, allowing you to use HTML in Widget and write them in rich text.

However, for anyone who really wants to display a wide range of content types, from nicely formatted text, to images and other media without learning HTML and CSS.
